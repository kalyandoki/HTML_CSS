      Right now you are reading English. That means that you are
      using your brain in a very active way. Reading is a very active process.
      It is true that the writer does a lot of work, but the reader also has to
      work hard. When you read a text, you have to do some or all of these:

      imagine a scene in your head 
      
      understand clearly what the writer is trying
      to say 
      
      agree or disagree with the writer
